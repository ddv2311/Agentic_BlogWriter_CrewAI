# Agentic Blog Writer with CrewAI

This project leverages the [CrewAI](https://github.com/crewAIInc/crewAI) framework to automate the creation of blog posts through a collaborative team of AI agents. Each agent is assigned a specific role, working together to generate coherent and insightful blog content.

**Note:** This implementation uses **Gemini 1.5 Flash** as the primary LLM backend for fast and efficient generation. You can also use **OpenAI** if you prefer, but **Gemini 1.5 Flash** has been chosen here because it is free and open source.

## üß† Overview

The system is designed to streamline the blog writing process by delegating tasks to specialized agents. The workflow includes:

1. **Topic Research**: Gathering information on the given topic.
2. **Content Drafting**: Generating the initial draft of the blog post.
3. **Editing**: Refining the draft for clarity, grammar, and style.
4. **Finalization**: Compiling the final version of the blog post.

## üìÅ Project Structure

The repository comprises the following key files:

* `agents.py`: Defines the roles and behaviors of each AI agent.
* `tasks.py`: Outlines the specific tasks assigned to each agent.
* `crew.py`: Orchestrates the agents and manages the workflow.
* `tools.py`: Provides auxiliary tools and utilities to support agent tasks.
* `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required to run the project.
* `new-blog-post.md`: Contains the output of the latest blog post generated by the system.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions

To set up and run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ddv2311/Agentic_BlogWriter_CrewAI.git
   cd Agentic_BlogWriter_CrewAI
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add your API keys:

   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
   ```

5. **Run the Blog Writer**:

   ```bash
   python crew.py
   ```

   Upon execution, the system will generate a new blog post and save it to `new-blog-post.md`.

## ü§© Customization

To tailor the blog writing process to your needs:

* **Modify Agent Roles**: Edit `agents.py` to change agent behaviors or add new agents.
* **Adjust Tasks**: Update `tasks.py` to redefine the tasks or their sequences.
* **Enhance Tools**: Extend `tools.py` with additional utilities or integrations.
